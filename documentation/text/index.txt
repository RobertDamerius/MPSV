<h1>MPSV</h1>
    The <b>M</b>otion <b>P</b>lanner for <b>S</b>urface <b>V</b>ehicles solves motion planning problems for fully actuated surface vehicles with non-linear dynamics in an environment with non-convex non-moving obstacles.
    The method is based on the RRT* algorithm.
    The problem is decomposed into two sequential problems in which first a feasible path is searched for and then a collision-free trajectory is calculated based on the path found.
    An example is shown in the following figure.

<h2>Planning Levels</h2>
    The API of MPSV consists of several planning levels that are shown in the following image.

    <b>PathPlanner</b>
    <ul>
    <li>find path from initial pose to final pose</li>
    <li>RRT* with fixed number of nodes and warm start capabilities</li>
    </ul>

    <b>MotionPlanner</b>
    <ul>
    <li>find trajectory from initial state/input to final pose around a given path</li>
    <li>RRT* with fixed number of nodes</li>
    <li>internal control system based full-state feedback to generate dynamically feasible trajectory</li>
    </ul>

    <b>SequentialPlanner</b>
    <ul>
    <li>combine path and motion planner in sequential manner</li>
    <li>path from path planner is used as guidance for the motion planner</li>
    </ul>

    <b>OnlinePlanner</b>
    <ul>
    <li>continuously solve sequential planning problems</li>
    <li>solves motion planning problems for a future timepoint</li>
    <li>merges solution trajectory seamless with a previous solution</li>
    </ul>

    <b>AsyncOnlinePlanner</b>
    <ul>
    <li>run the online planner in a separate thread</li>
    <li>results are obtained via polling or callback</li>
    </ul>
